# Python-Data-Science-Machine-Learning-Bootcamp

Data analysis, data visualization and machine learning using Python.
A few projects I worked on while taking Jose Portilla's Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp (Udemy)

Data analysis using NumPy and Pandas.
Data visualization using Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly and Cufflinks.
Machine learning using Scikit-learn.

Data analysis:
- 911 call dataset (from Kaggle)
- Bank stock analysis (Fetch information directly from yahoo)

Machine learning:
- Linear regression model on an ecommerce with a website and an app (Which one should they keep on improving)
- Logistic regression model on whether an user would click on the ad based on the user's characteristics
- K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to analyze an anonymized data set.
- Decision trees and Random forests to analyze a loan data set (including some data cleaning)
- Support vector machine (SVM) to analyze the built-in Iris data set of Seaborn
- K means clustering to group and classify universities as either private or public 
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze and classify text from Yelp reviews into the correct rating (stars 1 to 5)
