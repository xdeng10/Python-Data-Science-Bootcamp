# Python-Data-Science-Machine-Learning-Bootcamp

Data analysis, data visualization and machine learning using Python.
A few projects I worked on while taking Jose Portilla's Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp (Udemy)

Data analysis using **NumPy** and **Pandas**.
Data visualization using **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Plotly** and **Cufflinks**.
Machine learning using **Scikit-learn** and **nltk**.
Deep learning using **Kears** and **TensorFlow**.

Data analysis:
- 911 call dataset (from Kaggle)
- Bank stock analysis (Fetch information directly from yahoo)

Machine learning:
- **Linear regression model** on an ecommerce with a website and an app (Which one should they keep on improving)
- **Logistic regression model** on whether an user would click on the ad based on the user's characteristics
- **K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** to analyze an anonymized data set.
- **Decision trees and Random forests** to analyze a loan data set (including some data cleaning)
- **Support vector machine (SVM)** to analyze the built-in Iris data set of Seaborn
- **K means clustering** to group and classify universities as either private or public 
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to analyze and classify text from Yelp reviews into the correct rating (stars 1 to 5)


Deep learning:
- **Binary Classification** to analyze data from LendingClub and assess the likelihood of a new potential customer to pay back their loan using deep learning. This project also includes data analysis (prior to training) and data cleaning (Create dummies to convert string values into numerical values/categories and remove or fill missing data (NaN))
